# Suzana Ferreira -First Milestone Project- Code Institute

User Centric Front End Development
This is my first project showing what I've learned about HTML, CSS, Boostrap, Github and UX.

## Demo
A live demo can be accessed at https://github.com/suzanaferreira/my-first-website

## UX

The goal of the website was to make the access as simple as possible using easy language and delicate colours to match with the purpose of the content which is to relax at a Spa.

## Technologies

1.HTML
2.CSS
3.Boostrap

## Testing

This website was manually and carefully tested and inspected to be responsive at all size devices, prioritizing mobile devices.
